/*
- An array in Java is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
- Arrays can hold primitive data types (like int, char, etc.) as well as objects (like String or custom objects).
- The length of an array is fixed and specified when the array is created.
- Array elements are accessed by their index, starting from 0 to length-1.
- Arrays in Java are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0.
- The size of an array cannot be changed once it is created.
