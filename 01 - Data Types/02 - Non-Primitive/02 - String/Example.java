/*
- A String in Java is a sequence of characters.
- Strings are objects in Java, and they are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created.
- Strings can be created using string literals (enclosed in double quotes) or by using the new keyword to create a new String object.
- String objects in Java are backed by a character array, and they have several methods for manipulating and accessing their contents.
- Strings in Java support many operations, such as concatenation, substring extraction, and comparison.
- The Java String class provides a rich set of methods for working with strings, making string manipulation easy and efficient.
