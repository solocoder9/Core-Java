/*
- A double data type in Java is a primitive data type used to store decimal numbers.
- It occupies 64 bits (8 bytes) of memory.
- It has a range from approximately 4.9E-324 to 1.7976931348623157E+308.
- Double variables are useful when you need to store numbers with fractional parts and require higher precision than float.
- They are commonly used for financial calculations, scientific computations, and other situations where high precision is required.
- The default value of a double variable is 0.0.
