/*
- A boolean data type in Java is used to store two possible values: true or false.
- It is commonly used for representing conditions in control statements and boolean expressions.
- Boolean variables are widely used in programming for decision-making and branching.
- In Java, the size of a boolean value is not explicitly defined by the language specification, 
  but it is typically implemented as a single bit.
- The default value of a boolean variable is false.
