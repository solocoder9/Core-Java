# Try-with-Resources in Java

- In Java, the try-with-resources statement is a `try` statement that declares one or more resources.  
- A resource is an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it.  
- The try-with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement automatically, regardless of whether the `try` block completes normally or due to an exception.  
- It was introduced in Java 1.7 (Java 7).  
- It reduces boilerplate code and improves reliability by ensuring resources are always closed properly.  
- This minimizes the risk of resource leaks and makes code cleaner and easier to maintain.  
- It leverages the `AutoCloseable` interface and handles exceptions related to resource management gracefully.  
- Resources used in the try-with-resources statement must implement `AutoCloseable`, which provides the `close()` method.
