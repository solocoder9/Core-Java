Error
-----
- An error in Java is a subclass of Throwable that represents serious problems 
  that are typically beyond the control of the application, indicating issues 
  in the JVM or the environment.
- In other words, an error is a type of Throwable that indicates serious problems 
  that a reasonable application should not try to catch. 
- Errors are typically used to indicate errors in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 
  itself or in the environment in which the JVM is running. Errors are not meant 
  to be caught or handled by regular Java programs, as they usually signify 
  irrecoverable problems.
