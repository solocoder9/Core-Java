Exception Propagation
---------------------
- It is an mechanism by which an exception is passed from method to method up the call stack 
  until it is handled.
- When an exception occurs in a method, the method creates an exception object and passes it 
  to the runtime system. The runtime system then searches for a block of code that handles 
  the exception.
- If the exception is not handled in the current method, it is propagated to the calling method. 
  This process continues up the call stack until the exception is either caught and handled or 
  it reaches the top of the call stack, resulting in the termination of the program.
