  - Multithreading allows concurrent execution of two or more threads, enabling efficient CPU utilization and better application performance.

  - **Thread**
    - A thread is a lightweight process, a separate path of execution in a program.  

  - **Main Thread**
    - The thread that runs the `main()` method is called the main thread.
