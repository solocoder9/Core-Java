Singleton Pattern
-----------------
- The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has one instance and provides a global point of
  access to it.
- Theis is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to cordinate actions across
  the system.

Key Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Private constructor to prevent instantiation(creation & initialization).
● A static method to provide access to the instance.
● Lazy or eager initialization.
