try with resources
------------------
- In Java, the try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more 
  resources. A resource is an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it. 
- The try-with-resources statement ensures that each resoure is closed at the end of the statement.
  This is done automatically, regardless of whether the 'try' block  completes normally or due to
  an exception.
- It was introduced in Java 7(aka Java 1.7 verson).
- It reduces boilerplate code and improves the reliability of code by ensuring resources and always
  closed properly. This minimizes the risk of resource leaks and makes code cleaner and easier to 
  maintain.
- It leverages the 'AutoCloseable' inteface and handles exceptions related to reasoure management 
  gracefully. Resources used in the 'try-with-resources' statement must implement 'AutoCloseable',
  which provide the 'close()' method.
