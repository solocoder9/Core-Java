Exception Propagation
---------------------
- It is an mechanism by which an exception is passed from method to method 
  up the call stack until it is handled.
- When an exception occurs in a method, the method creates an exception object 
  and hands it off to the runtime system. The runtime system then looks for the 
  handling code for that exception. If the exception is not handled in the current
  method, it is propagated to the calling method, and this process continues until 
  either the exception is caught and handled or it reaches the top of the call stack
  and the program terminates.
