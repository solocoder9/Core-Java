What is Java?
-------------
- Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world.
- It is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have few 
  implementation dependencies as possible.
- Java is fast, secure, and reliable, making it widely used for developing applications across
  various devices, such as laptops, data centers, gaming consoles, scientific supercomputer, etc.
- Java is intended to let programmers "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled
  Java code (Bytecode) can run on all platform that support Java, without recompilation.


History Of Java
---------------
- Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995.
- James Gosling and his team started the project in the early 1990s.
- Before Java, its name was Oak, However, since Oak was already a registered trademark, James
  Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.


Features of Java
----------------
● Simple
~~~~~~~~
- Java is simple because it is easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand.
- Java Does not have complex features like pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritance.
- Java has an automatic garbage collector that manages memory, eliminating the need for explicit
  memory allocation and deallocation.

● Object-Oriented
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means every problem is solved with respect
  to object.
- In other words, object-oriented programming organizes software as a combination of different types
  of objects that incorporate both data band behavior.

● Portable
~~~~~~~~~~
- Java is portable because it allows Java bytecode to be carried to any platform. It doesn't need 
  or require re-implementation.
- Basically, portable means the same Java bytecode can run on any computer system has Java interpreter.

● Secure
~~~~~~~~
- Java is highly secure due to:
    ○ Sandbox Execution: Java programs run inside a virtual machine (sandbox), preventing unauthorized
      access to system resources.
    ○ Bytecode Verifier: Checks code for illegal operations that could violate access rights.
    ○ No Explicit Pointers: Eliminates risks associated with pointer manipulations.
    ○ Security Packages: Java provides libraries like 'java.security' for implementing security features.

● Platform Independent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any platform with a JVM.
- This makes Java architecture-neutral and eliminates the need for platform-specific modifications.

● Robust
~~~~~~~~
- Java is robust due to:
    ○ Strong Memory Management: Automatic garbage collection prevents memory leaks.
    ○ Exception Handling: Provides a mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully.
    ○ Type Checking: Ensure types safety at compile time.

● Architecture Neutral
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Java programs are not tied to any specific hardware architecture.
- For example, the size of primitive data types (e.g., int, char) is fixed across all platforms.
- Basically, In C Programming, the int data type occupies 2 bytes on a 32-bit system and 4 bytes on a
  640bit system. However, in Java, 'int' always occupies 4 bytes, regardless of the system architecture.

● High-Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Java is faster than traditional interpreted languages because its bytecode is close to native code.
- However, it is slightly slower than compiled languages like C++ due to its interpreted nature.

● Interpreted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Java is both compiled and interpreted:
    ○ Java source code is compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler.
    ○ Then, this bytecode is executed on the JVM, which acts as a software-based interpreter.

● Multithreaded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously.
- This maximizes CPU utilization and improves applications performance.

● Distributed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Java is distributed, meaning that programs can be designed to run on computer networks.
- Java facilitates the creation of distributed applications.

● Dynamic
~~~~~~~~~
- Java is dynamic because it loads classes at runtime. This allows for flexibility and adaptability 
  in application development.

● Statically Typed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Java is statically typed, meaning type checking is performed at compile time. This ensures the 
  type safety and reduces runtime errors.

● Strongly Typed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Java is strongly typed, enforcing strict type rules. Variables cannot be implicitly converted to 
  another type without explicit conversion.


Why is Java Popular?
--------------------
● Versatility: Used in web development, mobile apps (Android), enterprise application, cloud 
  computing, and more.

● Rich Ecosystem: Java hs a vast library (Java Standard Library) and frameworks (Spring, Hibernate,
  etc.) that simplify development.

● Community Support: Java has a large and active developer community, ensuring continuous updates 
  and support.

● Cross-Platform Compatibility: Java application can run on any device with a JVM.
