| **Parameters**          | **C++**                                                                 | **Java**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Platform**             | C++ is platform-dependent.                                             | Java is platform-independent.                                            |
| **Mainly used for**      | C++ is mainly used for system programming.                             | Java is mainly used for application programming (Windows, web, enterprise, mobile). |
| **Compilation**          | C++ is a compiled language.                                            | Java is considered both compiled and interpreted.                        |
| **Portability**          | C++ does not support portability.                                      | Java supports portability.                                               |
| **Memory Management**    | Memory management in C++ is manual.                                    | Memory management in Java is system-controlled.                          |
| **Orientation**          | C++ is both procedural and object-oriented.                            | Java is a purely object-oriented programming language.                    |
| **Documentation**        | C++ does not support documentation comments for source code.           | Java supports documentation comments for source code.                     |
| **Goto Keyword**         | C++ supports the `goto` keyword.                                       | Java does not support the `goto` keyword.                                |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | Supports both single and multiple inheritance.                         | Supports only single inheritance; multiple inheritance is achieved via interfaces. |
| **Pointer Support**      | Strongly supports pointers.                                            | Limited support for pointers.                                            |
| **Virtual Keyword**      | Supports virtual keyword.                                              | Does not support virtual keyword.                                        |
| **Structure & Union**    | Supports structures and unions.                                        | Does not support structures and unions.                                  |
| **Thread Support**       | No built-in support; relies on third-party libraries.                  | Has built-in thread support.                                             |
| **Overloading**          | Supports method and operator overloading.                              | Supports only method overloading, not operator overloading.              |
| **Parameter Passing**    | Supports both pass by value and pass by reference.                     | Supports only pass by value.                                             |
| **Object Management**    | Manual (`new` & `delete`).                                             | Automatic (garbage collection).                                          |
| **Libraries**            | Limited libraries with low-level functionalities.                      | Diverse libraries with a wide range of high-level services.              |
| **Global Scope**         | Supports global scope and namespace scope.                             | Does not support global scope.                                           |
| **Hardware**             | Closer to hardware.                                                    | Less interactive with hardware.                                          |
| **Founder**              | Founded by **Bjarne Stroustrup**.                                      | Founded by **James Gosling**.                                            |
| **try/catch Block**      | Can exclude the `try/catch` block.                                     | Must use `try/catch` if code throws a checked exception.                 |
| **Runtime Error Handling** | Programmerâ€™s responsibility to check errors.                          | System checks and handles runtime errors.                                |
