Specialization
--------------
- This is the opposite of generalization. 
- It involves creating specialized subclasses from a more general superclass. 
- Specialization allows you to define classes that are more specific and detailed, 
  inheriting common attributes and behaviors from the superclass while adding their 
  own unique features.

  Example:-
  Using the previous example, the Car, Bike, and Truck classes would be considered 
  specialized subclasses of the Vehicle superclass. Each subclass inherits the common
  attributes and behaviors from Vehicle and adds its own specific properties, such as 
  numWheels for Car and Bike, and cargoCapacity for Truck.
