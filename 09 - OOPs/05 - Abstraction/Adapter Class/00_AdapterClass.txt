Adapter Class in Java
---------------------
- An adapter class is a design pattern that provides a default or partial implementation of an interface
  or abstract class, allowing other classes to override only the method they are interested in.
- This pattern is particularly useful when working with interfaces or abstract class that have multiple
  methods, but you only need to implement a subset of those methods.
  
- In simple words, an adapter class is a class that provides default (often empty) implementations for 
  the methods of an interface or abstract class, allowing subclasses to override only the methods they 
  are interested in.
