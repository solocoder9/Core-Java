## What is OOPs in Java?

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a fundamental programming paradigm based on the concept 
  of **objects**, which can contain:
  - **Data** → as fields (properties or attributes)  
  - **Code** → as methods (functionality or behavior)

- OOP makes code more **organized, reusable, and easier to maintain** by modeling real-world entities.  

- There are **6 core concepts** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):  
  1. **Class**  
  2. **Object**  
  3. **Inheritance**  
  4. **Polymorphism**  
  5. **Abstraction**  
  6. **Encapsulation**
