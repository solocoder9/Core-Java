# Introduction to Java 8

- Java 8, released in March 2014, introduced significant enhancements and features that transformed the way Java is used, making it more efficient and expressive. 

## Key Features

1. **Lambda Expressions**  
   - Provide a clear and concise way to represent a single method interface using an expression.  
   - Make it easier to pass behavior as parameters.  

2. **Functional Interfaces**  
   - Interfaces that contain a single abstract method.  
   - Enable the use of lambda expressions and method references.  
   - Promote a cleaner, more expressive approach to coding.  

3. **Streams API**  
   - Revolutionizes the way collections are handled.  
   - Allows processing sequences of elements in a functional manner.  
   - Supports operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.  
   - Improves code readability and maintainability.  

4. **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**  
   - Interfaces can include default methods with implementation.  
   - Provides greater flexibility in interface design.  
   - Allows adding new methods to existing interfaces without breaking backward compatibility.  

5. **Optional Class**  
   - Addresses common pitfalls of null references.  
   - Provides a container for optional values.  
   - Reduces the risk of `NullPointerException`.  
   - Promotes more robust code.  

6. **New Date and Time API**  
   - The `java.time` package provides a comprehensive and user-friendly approach to date and time manipulation.  
   - Resolves many limitations of the old `Date` and `Calendar` classes.  

7. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**  
   - Lightweight engine to execute JavaScript code directly within Java applications.  
   - Enhances Java’s versatility.  

8. **CompletableFuture**  
   - Enhances Java’s concurrency capabilities.  
   - Provides a more flexible way to handle asynchronous programming.  
   - Allows easier composition of asynchronous tasks.
