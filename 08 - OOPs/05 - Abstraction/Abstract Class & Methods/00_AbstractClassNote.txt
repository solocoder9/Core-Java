Abstract Class
--------------
- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a 
  blue print for other classes.
- It can contain abstract method (method without a body) and concreate methods (methods
  with body).
- Abstract classes are used to define commond attributes and methods that mutiple derived
  classes can share.

Rules
~~~~~
- An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
- An abstract can have member variables, blocks, constructors, and methods.
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly. You must create subclass that implements
  its abstract methods.
- It a class contains one or more abstract methods, it must be declared abstract.
