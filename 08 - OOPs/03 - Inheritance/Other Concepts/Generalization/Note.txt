Generalization
--------------
- In Java, generalization refers to the concept of creating a superclass to 
  represent common attributes and behaviors of multiple classes.
- It involves identifying commonalities among classes and creating a more 
  general superclass to represent these common characteristics.
- Generalization allows to factor out shared attributes and behaviors ffrom 
  multiple classes into a single, more abstract class.
- It promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- we can achive generalization by using extends keword(Inheritance).

  Example:-
  Consider a superclass Vehicle that represents common attributes and behaviors of 
  different types of vehicles, such as cars, bikes, and trucks. Each specific type 
  of vehicle can then be represented by a subclass that inherits from the Vehicle 
  class and adds its own unique attributes and behaviors.
